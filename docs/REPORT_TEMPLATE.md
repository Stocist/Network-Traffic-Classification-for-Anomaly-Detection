# Network Traffic Classification for Anomaly Detection — Report (≤8 pages)

## Cover
- Project title, group members & IDs, tutor, link to demo video.

## 1. Introduction & Background
- Problem framing: normal vs anomaly traffic; business/operational context.

## 2. System Architecture
- Diagram: React (presentation) ↔ FastAPI (application) ↔ packaged AI model.
- Tech choices: MUI, Chart.js, FastAPI; rationale.

## 3. Front End
- Input validation, state flow, API calls, responsiveness, accessibility.

## 4. Back End
- FastAPI setup, routers, Pydantic schemas, middleware, error handling.

## 5. AI Model Integration
- Assignment‑2 model recap; preprocessing; thresholding; explainability.

## 6. Data Visualisation
- Three charts (gauge, confusion matrix, feature importance), interactivity.

## 7. Results & Performance
- Latency, caching, payload sizes, UI performance observations.

## 8. Conclusion & Future Work
- E.g., streaming capture, RBAC, export, alerting.

## References
- Harvard style.

## Appendix
- Full API (`docs/API.md`), extra figures, test evidence.
