# Acknowledgement of AI Use

This project used AI assistance for:
- Repository scaffolding and boilerplate code generation (FastAPI + React)
- Writing placeholder documentation and endpoint descriptions
- Non-critical UI components (charts) and validation examples

All model training decisions, dataset preparation, and evaluation were performed by the project authors.
