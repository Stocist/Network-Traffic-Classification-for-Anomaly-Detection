# Misinfo Dataset

## Data Description
- **Label meaning:**
  - `0` → **Real** (credible or verified information)  
  - `1` → **Fake** (false, misleading, or unverified content)

---

## Potential Objectives
Students can practice the following skills:
1. **Text preprocessing**: remove stopwords, links, emojis; perform tokenization, stemming, lowercasing.  
2. **Feature extraction**: TF-IDF vectors, n-grams, sentiment features, readability metrics.  
3. **Visualization**:
   - Distribution of post lengths (real vs fake)  
   - Word clouds for each class  
   - n-gram frequency bar charts  
4. **Model training & evaluation**:
   - Train models such as Logistic Regression or SVM  
   - Evaluate using Accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrices

## Visualization Suggestions
- **Class distribution**: bar chart of real vs fake samples  
- **Text length**: histogram comparing lengths of real vs fake news  
- **Word clouds**: separate clouds for real and fake  
- **Feature analysis**: visualize TF-IDF scores with box plots

## Notes
- The dataset is **text-based**, no executable content is involved, making it safe and straightforward for NLP practice.  

Good luck, and have fun analyzing the data!
